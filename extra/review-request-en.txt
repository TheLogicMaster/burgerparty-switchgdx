Hi,

I recently published Burger Party, a time management game for Android where you play a fast-food owner who must put together the burgers ordered by her customers before times run out.

Burger Party stands out from other burger games with:

- Several worlds to visit: United States, Pirates and Japan with some world-specific burger ingredients, for example a coconut drink in the Pirate world, or a rice bun in Japan.

- Three difficulty levels:
  * "Kids" is geared towards younger players: no timer, more patient customers
  * "Normal" is just, well, normal
  * "Experts" comes with shorter level times and less patient customers

- Cute cartoonish graphics.

- "Perfects": in addition to the classic 3-stars score, if you really nail a level fast enough, you get a "Perfect" ribbon. Getting "Perfects" for all levels is quite challenging!

Burger Party is available for free on Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.agateau.burgerparty
